# Andrew Hanasiro

I work as Software Engineer since 2018. I love to learn new things and teach others. If you are here looking to learn new technology or to copy code, feel free to ask, open an issue, or suggest improvement!

This project below is still in progress but already has a lot of my knowledge and experience. Since, each of those systems is quitely big, I just put the link. Each one of them has a detailed description.

## Project Auth+

Systems as if this organization was a real Startup! All those projects must challenge me in a way (language, concepts, or tools), but all this effort should have a target: simulate microservices in the company.

### Pitch

A lot of startups have a dilemma: should I create an Authentication/Authorization system **or** should I integrate with another? The trade-off is simple,

- Cons of Creating a new one
  - time to waste
  - the human effort to code
  - the risk of making incorrect/mistakes
  - maintenance after done
- Cons of integration
  - a high cost
  - the effort to integrate.
  - a high cost to customize if necessary
